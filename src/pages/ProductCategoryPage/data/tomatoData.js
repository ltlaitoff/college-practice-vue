		"Agridera aims to be one of the world's leading companies in the breeding, production, and marketing of tomato seeds. **We invest intensively in research and development to provide solutions to growers and consumers in numerous countries around the world.** In particular, we breed improved disease-resistant cultivars adapted to different markets globally.\n\n Currently, emphasis is placed on combining Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) and Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) resistances with other soil borne diseases into superior tomato breeding lines and hybrids. Moreover, comprehensive efforts are being undertaken to develop varieties resistance to TBRFV virus (Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus). \n\n In terms of horticultural traits, breeding is for earliness, different fruit sizes, firmness, red fruit color, flavor, crack resistance, shelf life, and high/low temperature fruit set. Combinations of quality features and disease resistance are sought in a variety of types, namely round and elongated shapes.",
